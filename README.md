# Task Management Application

## Description

This is a Task Management Application built with React. The application allows users to organize tasks into different categories: "Todo", "In Progress", and "Closed". Users can add new tasks, move them between categories, and remove them when completed.

### Key Features
- **Categorize Tasks:** Tasks are organized into three categories: "Todo", "In Progress", and "Closed".
- **Drag and Drop:** Move tasks between categories using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Task Creation:** Add new tasks directly from each category.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are persisted using local storage.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
   cd task-management-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **`components/`**: React components used in the application.
    - `ListTasks.js`: Main component that lists tasks by category.
    - `CreateTask.js`: Component to create new tasks.
    - `Task.js`: Component that represents a single task.
    - `Header.js`: Component for the header of each section.

## Approach

The application is structured to manage tasks through different states using React hooks. Here's a brief overview of the approach:

1. **State Management:** 
   - Use React's `useState` hook to manage task lists and form visibility.
   - Use `useEffect` to filter tasks based on their status whenever the task list changes.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Tasks are categorized based on their status: "todo", "inprogress", and "closed".
   - Tasks are filtered and displayed according to their status.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**
   - Implemented using `react-dnd` to enable dragging tasks between categories.

4. **Task Creation:**
   - A form to add new tasks is conditionally rendered at the end of each section.
   - Tasks are added with a status corresponding to the section in which they are created.

5. **Persistence:**
   - Tasks are saved to and loaded from `localStorage` to maintain state across page reloads.
